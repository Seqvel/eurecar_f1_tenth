# Eurecar F1tenth Project
This project is based on F1TENTH Project.
Please refer to the following site:

[https://f1tenth.org/](https://f1tenth.org/)

[https://github.com/f1tenth-dev/simulator](https://github.com/f1tenth-dev/simulator)

This project provides gazebo simulator and messages. 
Therefore, it is a proper environment to implement such as vehicle control, simple mapping, and localization algorithm. We hope you to try whatever you want to test in this simulator. We modified the origin f1tenth model for you to use an IMU sensor. Also, we added the oval shape easy map.

## ROS install guidance
For ROS-beginner, we provide you a link installing ROS.

We recomment you to install ROS-melodic distro.

you can follow the instruction here:
[ROS-melodic-installation/Ubuntu](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)

Also, you can follow the documentation to start ROS and set the environment to use ros-command comfortably.
See this page: [ROS/StartGuide](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/StartGuide)

## F1tenth 
If you finish to install ROS-melodic, you need to do git clone:
```
user@ros-computer: cd ~/catkin_ws/src
user@ros-computer: git clone https://github.com/Leedk3/eurecar_f1_tenth.git
user@ros-computer: cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

## F1tenth Gazebo 
We divided the origin f1tenth launch file into 2 steps: 
1. start gazebo
2. keyborad controller to move vehicle
```
user@ros-computer: roslaunch f1tenth-sim simulator.launch
user@ros-computer: roslaunch f1tenth-sim key_control.launch
```
You can modify the key_controller to add the motion or decrease the highest speed in the simulator.

If your vehicle does not move even though you followed the instruction in the **ros/f1tenth-dev**, here are some possibilities we have experienced and resolved it. When packages listed below were not installed, the vehicle did not move and the error occurred. 

1. effort controller
```
user@ros-computer: sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-effort-controllers
```
2. gazebo packages
```
user@ros-computer: sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-gazebo-dev
user@ros-computer: sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control
user@ros-computer: sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-gazebo-ros
``` 

## Oval track
For using oval-shaped track, you need to copy some files in ~/.gazebo/models (If you don't have the directory, run `mkdir -p ~/.gazebo/models`)
```
user@ros-computer: cp -r /simulator/world/oval_track ~/.gazebo/models
```

The 2D map can be generated using a sensor model in the gazebo environment. This figure is an example of map building process in gazebo environment. The sensors used for map building are 2D Hokuyo LiDAR and 3DM-GX5-25 IMU sensors.

Here is the result of the generated 2D map using Google Cartographer in the track.

As a 2D map building algorithm, Cartographer and Gmapping are mainly used. Please refer to the following site:

Google Cartographer: [https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#](https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

Gmapping: [http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping)

Note that when using a Cartographer, the vehicle's odometry may be necessary to increase the accuracy of map building performance. In the 2D map generated by these map building algorithm, we can estimate the position of the vehicle using LiDAR and IMU sensor data.
## Vehicle Controller
### 1.Waypoint Recording with manual driving (waypoint_recorder)

Please refer to the waypoint_recorder package.

To record,
```
user@ros-computer: rosrun waypoint_recorder recorder.py
```
To visualize the saved waypoint trajectory,
```
user@ros-computer: rosrun waypoint_recorder loader.py
```

### 2. Design the skeleton code to control the vehicle (waypoint_follower)
Please refer to the waypoint_follwer package.

To run the controller,
```
user@ros-computer: rosrun waypoint_follower controller.py
```
